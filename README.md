Project 2 for Game Development Fall 2021

Goal:
- Make it to the end of the stage without losing all of your lives.

Controls:
- WASD, or Arrow Keys to move
- W, Space, or Up Arrow to jump
- S, or Down Arrow to crouch
- Shift to go invisible
    - Invisibility can be used to phase through white walls and enemies, although there is a limit to how long you can use it for.

Known Bugs/Issues:
- Sometimes, after falling into a pit the player gets launched upwards or through the ground whenever they respawn. This issue is sort of fixed by setting the player's velocity to 0 before they respawn, although it still persists.
- Sometimes the ghost power meter in the UI will get locked and won't refil. The cause behind this bug is unknown.
- Sometimes sounds effects play over each other.
- Sometimes the player’s jump launches them too far. This usually only happens when jumping on the corners of platforms.
